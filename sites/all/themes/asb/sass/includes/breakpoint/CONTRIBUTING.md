## Contributing to Breakpoint

We love contributors! Yes we do! If you would like to contribute to Breakpoint, please follow the following guidelines:

* We are actively trying to stay away from Ruby functionality and am attempting to build this entirely with native Sass functionality. If you would like to add a feature that includes Ruby code, there needs to be a very very compelling case as to why.
* Each individual feature you would like to add, or bug you would like to squash, should be an individual pull request. Each pull request should be from an individual feature branch to either the latest stable or development branch. **The current *stable* branch is 2.x.x. The current *development* branch is 2.x.x**. Contributions that are not in the form of a pull request will not be considered. If your pull request does not apply cleanly we will ask you to fix that before we will look into pulling it in. We may ask you to update or make changes to the code you've submitted, please don't take this the wrong way. If a pull request smells (such as if a large amount of code is all within a single commit, or the coding standards aren't in line with core Breakpoint) we may ask you to rewrite your commit.
